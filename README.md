This repository contains the synthetic dataset with 300 simulation results of the 2D elastic wave equation. The features are extracted from peak and trough amplitude values of direct wave and reflected waves in time domain and peak amplitude values in frequency domain. The two lables are epsilon and delta respectively. These features of each simulation are reserved in Synthetic_Dataset.csv. 

This repository also allows to train 4 machine learning methods using the synthetic dataset : Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), one-dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), support vector regressor (SVR), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB).
